VueJS

- It's a progressive framework. Which means it can be used in a simple manner or for more complex topics like building an SPA or Server-Side Rendering.
- It's reactive, which means, if any value of any data is modified, Vue automatically modifies it in the view.

- Data Binding:
  - Create a Vue instance.
  - Bind it to an element from the DOM.
  - Specify some data.
  - Apply directives like 'v-model' to bind that element

- Using Vue DevTools:
  - Vue will automatically proxy all your data properties so you can access them all from an instance.

- Vue allows the data to be the single source of truth.

- Mounted: is a special method that it's called when the view is mounted, and executes any given instructions.
  - var app = new Vue({
      mounted() {
        // do sth...
      }
  })

- I can use methods linked with the v-on:click directive.

- v-on:click="methodName" --> @:click="methodName"
- v-bind:title="titleName" --> :title="titleName"
