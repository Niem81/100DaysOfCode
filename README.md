# 100DaysOfCode
Let's just do it! Not only to be part of sth amazing like this, but also , like someone pointed out to me, keep track of all what I'm doing and enjoy the ride!

## Days

### Day 1
Starting with some algorithms to exercise before going into programming. Some resources I recommend (also that I've been told by some friends) I would list them in sections below.

### Day 2
Started working on some Work stuff. The project I'm currently working on uses PHP - Laravel as backend and Angular 1 as Front end. Apart from that, I added another algorithm exercise from Codility. This time was introduction to Time Complexity problems, related to Big-O Notation.
Looking at the results from Codility, the solution is correct, but I have to improve in the amount of time it takes to solve it.

## Algorithm Resources - Practice
- HackerRank
- Project Euler
- Codility
