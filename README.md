# 100DaysOfCode
Joining the movement and started coding and keeping track for all I'm gonna do or build for the next 100 Days.
Update Dic-2018: Although I started this 9 months ago, I didn't measure time properly to keep track of 100DaysOfCode, so I'll re-start this path, following where I left this.

## Algorithm Resources - Practice
- HackerRank
- Project Euler
- Codility

## Days

### Day 1
Starting with some algorithms to exercise before going into programming. Some resources I recommend (also that I've been told by some friends) I would list them in sections below.

### Day 2
Started working on some Work stuff. The project I'm currently working on uses PHP - Laravel as backend and Angular 1 as Front end. Apart from that, I added another algorithm exercise from Codility. This time was introduction to Time Complexity problems, related to Big-O Notation.
Looking at the results from Codility, the solution is correct, but I have to improve in the amount of time it takes to solve it.

### Day 3
Time to solve some algorithms. Again on the codility track, now it's lecture time for Counting Elements.
It is important to consider the amount of elements an array have, and also know the various ways there is to store or handle that data. There is a limited available memory so if we have an Array of 100K elements, and run it through a nested for loop, you might have an answer to your problem, but it might mean using a lot of your resources.
- Codility:
* Chapter 3
  - PermMissingElem
* Chapter 4
  - FrogRiverOne
  - MissingInteger

### Day 4
Continue with exercises related to Chapter 4
- Codility:
* Chapter 4
  - MaxCounters

### Day 5
Started reviewing Addy Osmani's Design Patterns with Javascript.
All practices have been added to other repo in algorithms: https://github.com/Niem81/algorithms

### Day 6
Keeping up with Codility. Now in chapter 5 solving Preffix Sums.
- Codility:
* Chapter 5
  - CountDiv
  - PassingCars
  - GenomicRangeQuery

### Day 7
Focus mainly on the job. Working with PHP - Laravel.
In my project I'm using Lumen as a micro framework from Laravel to handle al backend.
For the latest task I'm coding, I'm using a Laravel library Serialize to handle Social Login. In this particular case applied for Facebook.
Apart from that, practising some Interview questions from here: https://www.toptal.com/algorithms/interview-questions (19 Essential Algorithm Questions)

### Day 8
It's been quite some time since I started this and: done some more programming, changed jobs, moved, etc. Now focusing on some Java Spring Development.
But I'll get back to Laravel as side projects 'cause I really liked the framework.
In day 8, I decided to learn about Artificial Intelligence.
Besides AI, I went back to start from scratch to learn ReactJS. I've seen tutorials months ago and done some projects, but I'll keep track from re-doing some other tutorials.

### Day 9
Started learning VueJS
I'm considering building a Blog for start writing different topics that I'm also learning at work.
Right now focusing on the business side by writing docs related to agile projects.

### Day 10
Let's start with some algorithms. I've decided that this year I will focus on keep learning algorithms.
I'm back to Codility and going to start with Sorting. I've done sorting before, but will see how this goes.
* What is Sorting?
  Is the process of arrnging data in certain order. Usually we sort by the value of elements, but that's not all. We can apply sorting in different ways aiming other topics or even data structures.
* Some mentioned types:
  - Selection sort
  - Counting sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Merge Sort
* Chapter 6 - Sorting
  - Distinct
  - MaxProductOfThree

### Day 11
Continue with some algorithms from Codility.
* Chapter 6 - Sorting
  - Triangle
  - NumberOfDiscIntersections

### Day 12
So the day started remembering something I saw on Alison Falk's IG, which is that sometimes, some developers do not manage to keep track of all 100DaysOfCode Challenge, and that it's true on my case. I think its being a pretty long time since I treid to keep this challenge up to date.
Said that, I saw a tutorial from Traversy Media on what things to know before learning a new JS Framework. Full disclosure, I've already been learning different frameworks, so it's good to review this topics.
* What to know before learning JS Frameworks:
  - JavaScript Fundamentals (Basic Syntax, variables, arrays, object literals, events, functions, loops, conditionals)
  - Modules
  - Classes
  - Arrow Functions
  - Promises / Asynchronous requests
  - Destructuring
  - Concept of Components & State
  - Spread Operator
  - High Order Array Functions

Later, I got back reviewing algorithms. This day I started with Stacks and Queues.
* Stack:
  Is a basic data structure in which the insertion and deletion takes place at the top. In this case, I imagine like all the  clothes at some point you pile in your bed, and in a way it forms this representation of Stack, or a group of dishes stack one over another.
Continue with some algorithms from Codility.
* Chapter 7 - Stacks n Queues
    - Brackets

### Day 13
The day before I finished and algorithm from Codility exercises. Now I'm continuing what I left in the exercises from Stacks and Queues.
* Chapter 7 - Stacks n Queues
  - Fish

### Day 14
I've started a tutorial on Vue creating a Realtime Chat App using Firebase as backend service.
* Some details:
  - When using v-for, the orderBy filter is no longer available in v2. For giving order to an array of elements, you can apply a computer property using lodash to return an ordered array.
  - In this particular tutorial, he is ordering the data applying functions from firebase collection, so the fetched data comes already ordered.

### Day 15
Going back to React basics. And at same time listening to some talks about React Hooks.
Starting with Fullstack React 30 days (I don't know if 30 days but still):
  - React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. Consider it as view layer for web applications.
  - Components are the hreat of React
