# 100DaysOfCode
Let's just do it! Not only to be part of sth amazing like this, but also , like someone pointed out to me, keep track of all what I'm doing and enjoy the ride!

## Days

### Day 1
Starting with some algorithms to exercise before going into programming. Some resources I recommend (also that I've been told by some friends) I would list them in sections below.

### Day 2
Started working on some Work stuff. The project I'm currently working on uses PHP - Laravel as backend and Angular 1 as Front end. Apart from that, I added another algorithm exercise from Codility. This time was introduction to Time Complexity problems, related to Big-O Notation.
Looking at the results from Codility, the solution is correct, but I have to improve in the amount of time it takes to solve it.

### Day 3
Time to solve some algorithms. Again on the codility track, now it's lecture time for Counting Elements.
It is important to consider the amount of elements an array have, and also know the various ways there is to store or handle that data. There is a limited available memory so if we have an Array of 100K elements, and run it through a nested for loop, you might have an answer to your problem, but it might mean using a lot of your resources.
